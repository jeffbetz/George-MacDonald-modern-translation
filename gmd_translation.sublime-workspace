I have compiled this list myself and\nworked out the definitions from context with the help of Margaret\nWest, from Leven in Fife, Scotland, and also by referring to a word\nlist found in a collection of poems by Robert Burns.  There are\nabout 6 words which we could not work out definitions for and would\nwelcome any feedback on those words or any others in the list which\nmay be wrong (my e-mail address is JaBBechard@aol.com).  This was\nnever meant to be a comprehensive list of the National Scottish\nLanguage, but rather an aid to understanding some of Mr MacDonald's\nconversations which are carried out in the Broad Scots.  I do\napologise for any mistakes or omissions.  I aimed for my list to be\nvery comprehensive, and it often repeats the same word in a plural\nor diminutive form.  As well, it includes words that are quite\nobvious to native English speakers.\n\nThere is a web site under construction which will feature the\nScottish language; and the National Scottish Dictionary can be\nconsulted if you have access to one.\n\nThis list is a compressed form that consists of three columns for\n'word', 'definition', and 'additional notes'.  It is set up with\na comma between each item and a hard return at the end of each\ndefinition.  This means that this section could easily be cut and\npasted into its own text file and imported into a database or\nspreadsheet as a comma separated variable file (.csv file).  Failing\nthat, you could do a search and replace for commas in this section\n(I have not used any commas in my words, definitions or notes) and\nreplace the commas with spaces or tabs.\n\n\nWORD,DEFINITION,NOTES\n\na',all,also have\na' thing,everything;

I have compiled this list myself and worked\nout the definitions from context with the help of Margaret West, from\nLeven in Fife, Scotland, and also by referring to a word list found in\na collection of poems by Robert Burns, _Chamber�s Scots Dialect\nDictionary from the 17th century to the Present_ c. 1911 and\n_Scots-English English-Scots Dictionary_ Lomond Books c. 1998. I have\ntried to be as thorough as possible given the limited resources and\nwelcome any feedback on this list (my e-mail address is\nJaBBechard@aol.com). This was never meant to be a comprehensive list of\nthe Scots Dialect, but rather an aid to understanding some of the\nconversations and references that appear in this novel. I do apologise\nfor any mistakes or omissions. I aimed for my list to be very\ncomprehensive, and it often repeats the same word in a plural or\ndiminutive form. As well, it includes words that are quite obvious to\nnative English speakers, only spelled in such a way to demonstrate the\nregional pronunciation.\n\nThis list is a compressed format that consists of three columns for\n�word�, �definition�, and �notes�. It is set up with a comma between\neach item and a hard return at the end of each definition. This means\nthat this section could easily be cut and pasted into its own text file\nand imported into a database or spreadsheet as a comma separated\nvariable file (.csv file). Failing that, you could do a search and\nreplace for commas in this section (I have not used any commas in my\nwords, definitions or notes) and replace the commas with spaces or\ntabs.\n\nWord,Definition,Notes\na',all;
