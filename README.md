# George-MacDonald-modern-translation
A project to translate the Scottish English from George MacDonald's books into modern English

Although I love the Scottish English of George MacDonald, it can sometimes be a barrier to understanding for the modern reader. 

As an effort to make his novels more accessible, and yet not spend an excessive amount of time, I'm mostly using a search and replace methods to translate. Though I'm being careful, this will result in some errors. Still, I believe the end product will be easier for the average modern reader to understand. Hopefully over time, the errors will get fixed as others help in the effort.
