  Note from John Bechard, creator of this Electronic text.

The following is a list of Scottish words which are found in George
MacDonald's "David Elginbrod".  I have compiled this list myself and
worked out the definitions from context with the help of Margaret
West, from Leven in Fife, Scotland, and also by referring to a word
list found in a collection of poems by Robert Burns.  There are
about 6 words which we could not work out definitions for and would
welcome any feedback on those words or any others in the list which
may be wrong (my e-mail address is JaBBechard@aol.com).  This was
never meant to be a comprehensive list of the National Scottish
Language, but rather an aid to understanding some of Mr MacDonald's
conversations which are carried out in the Broad Scots.  I do
apologise for any mistakes or omissions.  I aimed for my list to be
very comprehensive, and it often repeats the same word in a plural
or diminutive form.  As well, it includes words that are quite
obvious to native English speakers.

There is a web site under construction which will feature the
Scottish language; and the National Scottish Dictionary can be
consulted if you have access to one.

This list is a compressed form that consists of three columns for
'word', 'definition', and 'additional notes'.  It is set up with
a comma between each item and a hard return at the end of each
definition.  This means that this section could easily be cut and
pasted into its own text file and imported into a database or
spreadsheet as a comma separated variable file (.csv file).  Failing
that, you could do a search and replace for commas in this section
(I have not used any commas in my words, definitions or notes) and
replace the commas with spaces or tabs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note from John Bechard, transcriber of this electronic text.

The following is a list of Scottish words found in George MacDonald�s
_Alec Forbes of Howglen_. I have compiled this list myself and worked
out the definitions from context with the help of Margaret West, from
Leven in Fife, Scotland, and also by referring to a word list found in
a collection of poems by Robert Burns, _Chamber�s Scots Dialect
Dictionary from the 17th century to the Present_ c. 1911 and
_Scots-English English-Scots Dictionary_ Lomond Books c. 1998. I have
tried to be as thorough as possible given the limited resources and
welcome any feedback on this list (my e-mail address is
JaBBechard@aol.com). This was never meant to be a comprehensive list of
the Scots Dialect, but rather an aid to understanding some of the
conversations and references that appear in this novel. I do apologise
for any mistakes or omissions. I aimed for my list to be very
comprehensive, and it often repeats the same word in a plural or
diminutive form. As well, it includes words that are quite obvious to
native English speakers, only spelled in such a way to demonstrate the
regional pronunciation.

This list is a compressed format that consists of three columns for
�word�, �definition�, and �notes�. It is set up with a comma between
each item and a hard return at the end of each definition. This means
that this section could easily be cut and pasted into its own text file
and imported into a database or spreadsheet as a comma separated
variable file (.csv file). Failing that, you could do a search and
replace for commas in this section (I have not used any commas in my
words, definitions or notes) and replace the commas with spaces or
tabs.
